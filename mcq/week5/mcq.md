# Cloud data management

## According to the paper, which of these are characteristics that a cloud data management system should have?

- [ ] Proximity, these systems should be located close to the end users to be more
  performant.
- [x] Fault tolerance, because cloud servers are more likely to fail than
  high-end servers.
- [ ] Ability to run on high-end cloud servers.

# CAP theorem

## Which claims about the CAP theorem are accurate?

- [x] It states that not all of the CAP properties can be fulfilled
  simultaneously by networked shared-data systems.
- [ ] It is roughly equivalent to the ACID properties of relational database systems.
- [ ] CAP stands for Consistency, Adaptability, and Partition Tolerance.
- [ ] Modern data stores, such as Cassandra and BigTable have overcome the
  restrictions formalized by the CAP theorem.


# NoSQL drawbacks

## Which of these are drawbacks of most NoSQL data stores according to the paper?

- [ ] They often sacrifice availability in favor of consistency.
- [x] Lack of standardized interfaces.
- [x] Lack of full ACID transaction support, notably consistency.
- [ ] They are not as scalable as traditional SQL systems.
