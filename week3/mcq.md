# Micro-frontend drawbacks

## According to the paper, which of these are drawbacks of micro-frontend applications, compared to monolithic web applications?

- [ ] They don't allow for using different technology stacks between the
  subprograms.
- [x] The different subprograms may include the same dependencies, leading to
  slower performance.
- [x] There may be inconsistencies between the UI components of the different
  subprograms.

# Micro-frontend horizontal vs. vertical split

## Which of the claims regarding horizontal and vertical splits in micro-frontends are accurate?

- [ ] In a vertical split, a single page is split into smaller applications which
  are all responsible for different parts of the view.
- [x] In a vertical split, a monolithic web application is split into different
  subapplications according to the business domain.
- [ ] In a horizontal split, client-side composition is most often used for
  composing the different micro-frontend applications

# Micro-frontends vs. Microservices

## Which principles from microservices are also present in micro-frontends?

- [x] Allowing individual teams to make technological decisions instead of these
  being done in a centralized manner.
- [x] Strong focus on automating integration and deployment through CI/CD
