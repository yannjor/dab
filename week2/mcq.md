# Internet delivery challenges

## Which of the following options best correspond to problems in internet content delivery described in the paper?

- [x] The BGP routing protocol's performance has proved to be suboptimal in many
  cases, and has also shown to be vulnerable to attacks.
- [ ] The TCP protocol has proved unreliable, often suffering from packet loss.
- [x] Appropriately provisioning resources so as to be able to serve sudden
  increases in demand.

# Delivery networks

## Which of the following are advantages of using delivery networks compared to relying on traditional internet traffic?

- [ ] Delivery networks are less complex architecturally, and easier to maintain
  than traditional networks.
- [x] Delivery networks can be deployed rather easily over the existing internet, without
  having to redesign existing networks, thanks to their virtual nature.
- [x] Delivery networks can be adapted to specific use cases more easily, for
  example for media delivery or static content delivery.


# Akamai live streams

## In what ways does Akamai handle live streams differently than other types of content?

- [x] For live streams, Akamai makes use of an additional layer of servers between
  entrypoints and edge servers.
- [ ] Akamai handles live streams in a similar way as it does other video content.
- [ ] Akamai uses tiered distribution system for live streams, wherein a set of
  well provisioned and well connected edge clusters are used to cache content.
